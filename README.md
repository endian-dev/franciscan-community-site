# Franciscan Community Site

A mostly static Astro website for the St. Margaret of Cortona Fraternity,
deployed with Cloudflare Workers Static Assets.

Production URL: <https://stmargaretofcortona.endian.dev>

## Project Overview

This site is built to keep the runtime simple and the content editable. Astro
generates static HTML, Cloudflare serves the built files, and Pages CMS lets
nontechnical editors update Markdown and JSON content without working locally.

The site currently includes:

- fixed pages for Home, Who We Are, Get Involved, News, and FAQ
- FAQ entries managed as individual Markdown files
- news/resource entries managed as individual Markdown files
- shared site settings and contact information in JSON
- local upload folders for approved images and PDFs

## Requirements

- Node `22.22.2`
- Corepack
- pnpm `11.5.0`

Enable the pinned package manager:

```sh
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@11.5.0 --activate
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Commands

```sh
pnpm dev
pnpm check
pnpm check:uploads
pnpm build
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm preview
pnpm deploy
```

Important command behavior:

- `pnpm dev` runs the local Astro development server.
- `pnpm check` runs Astro type and content checks.
- `pnpm check:uploads` enforces local media upload limits.
- `pnpm build` runs upload checks, Astro checks, and the static build.
- `pnpm test:e2e` runs Playwright smoke tests against `pnpm preview`.
- `pnpm deploy` deploys the built site with Wrangler.

Build the site before running Playwright locally:

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm test:e2e
```

Install the Chromium test browser if it is not already available:

```sh
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
```

## Content Model

Content is organized so Pages CMS can expose editable fields without changing
the site structure.

| Content | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Site settings | `src/data/site.json` | Site name, description, home hero image, and contact info |
| Fixed pages | `src/content/pages/*.md` | Home, Who We Are, Get Involved, News, FAQ |
| FAQ entries | `src/content/faqs/*.md` | One Markdown file per question |
| News/resources | `src/content/resources/*.md` | One Markdown file per newsletter/resource |
| Uploaded images | `public/uploads/images/` | Local approved web images |
| Uploaded documents | `public/uploads/documents/` | Local approved PDFs |

Fixed page routes are required by the Astro pages. Do not remove or rename the
existing fixed page files unless the routes are changed in code at the same
time.

## Pages CMS

Pages CMS configuration lives in `.pages.yml`.

Editors can update:

- site settings and contact information
- the home hero image and alt text
- fixed page body content
- FAQ entries
- news/resource entries
- approved image and PDF uploads

Fixed page creation, deletion, and rename operations are disabled because the
site depends on those route files existing. FAQ and resource entries can be
created, edited, unpublished, and deleted through Pages CMS.

Pages CMS commits directly to `main`. Branch protection and app permissions
must continue to allow the Pages CMS app to write content updates.

## Media Upload Rules

Media uploads are intentionally constrained because uploaded files are committed
to git history. Deleted media still remains in repository history.

Allowed image formats:

- `webp`
- `jpg`
- `jpeg`
- `png`

Allowed document format:

- `pdf`

Build-time limits enforced by `scripts/check-uploads.mjs`:

- individual image: 1 MB maximum
- individual PDF: 5 MB maximum
- total `public/uploads/`: 25 MB maximum

Prefer external links for large, externally maintained, or frequently changing
PDFs.

## Home Hero

The home hero image is configured in `src/data/site.json`:

```json
{
  "homeHero": {
    "image": "/uploads/images/new-rec-2025-2028.jpg",
    "imageAlt": "Saint Thomas More Region Secular Franciscan members gathered around a regional banner."
  }
}
```

If `homeHero.image` is empty, the site renders an intentional no-image fallback.
When setting a hero image, provide meaningful alt text.

## Common Content Tasks

Update contact information:

- Edit `src/data/site.json`.
- Update `contact.name`, `contact.email`, `contact.phone`, and
  `contact.address`.
- The Get Involved page and footer both read from this shared data.

Add an FAQ:

- Add a Markdown file under `src/content/faqs/`.
- Set `question`, `order`, and `published` in frontmatter.
- Write the answer in Markdown body content.

Add a newsletter or resource:

- Add a Markdown file under `src/content/resources/`.
- Set `title`, `order`, `linkLabel`, `published`, and either `externalUrl` or
  `uploadedFile`.
- Use `externalUrl` for PDFs hosted elsewhere.
- Use `uploadedFile` only for local PDFs under `/uploads/documents/`.

Change the home hero image:

- Upload an approved image to `public/uploads/images/`.
- Update `homeHero.image` in `src/data/site.json`.
- Update `homeHero.imageAlt` with accurate alt text.
- Run `pnpm build` to confirm upload limits and schema validation pass.

## Deployment

The production target is Cloudflare Workers Static Assets. Deployment
configuration lives in `wrangler.jsonc`; Astro builds to `dist/`.

Use Cloudflare Workers Builds as the single production deploy path:

- production branch: `main`
- build command: `pnpm build`
- deploy command: `pnpm deploy`
- root directory: `/`
- package manager: Corepack with the pinned pnpm version from `package.json`

GitHub Actions is used as the merge gate and should not deploy production.
Workers Builds also runs non-production branch builds for PR preview URLs.

## Branch Workflow

This repository uses trunk-based development:

- `main` is the only long-lived branch and production source.
- Work happens on short-lived branches such as `feat/*`, `fix/*`,
  `chore/*`, and `docs/*`.
- Pull requests merge to `main` only after CI passes.
- Unfinished work should use drafts, hidden routes, preview builds, or feature
  flags rather than long-lived branches.

See `docs/repo-settings.md` for repository settings to apply in GitHub.

## Notes for Maintainers

- Keep the site static-first unless there is a clear requirement for SSR, APIs,
  or Worker request handling.
- A static Astro build does not need the `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter.
- Keep Astro trailing-slash behavior aligned with Cloudflare
  `assets.html_handling`.
- Do not commit generated output such as `dist/`, `.astro/`, or `.wrangler/`.
- Do not commit secrets, `.env` files, `.dev.vars`, Cloudflare tokens, or
  private configuration.
- pnpm dependency build-script approvals are recorded in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
  Keep that file in sync when dependency changes introduce new packages that
  need install-time build scripts.
